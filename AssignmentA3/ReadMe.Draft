My ColourTable class initially represents as an ArrayList, however due to the additional
    funtionality added of not allowed the same 2 colours to appear I've adjusted it to HashSet
    But realising I need to compare R,G,B Variables made me realise O(n) time would be better;


Validity is ensured by using some error checking classes in which we created. Refactored to its own package and class
    as it makes more sense in this case. Or else our code will have technical style debts.
